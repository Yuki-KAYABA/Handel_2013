# Summary of the Paper

（ひとことメモ）

- 保険マーケットにおける諸問題のうち、InertiaとAdverse Selectionの関係に注目した論文。
- いずれも保険マーケットの効率性を損なう問題として捉えられているが、両者には「Inertiaを減らして消費者が良い選択をできるようにするほどAdverse Selectionを助長する」という関係がある。
- そのため、（何らかの）NudgeによりInertiaを減らすことで、かえって経済厚生を損なう可能性がある。

## Motivation

- Investigate consumer inertia in health insurance markets.
- Potential concern of insurance markets:
  - Adverse Selection
  - Moral Hazard (hardly discussed in this paper)
  - Inertia: consumers are reluctant to make active choices
- Focus on the relationship between adverse selection and inertia.
- To do so, a choice model is developed and estimated, and using these estimates counterfactual simulation is conducted to study the impact of policies that nudge consumer toward better decisions by reducing inertia.
- The improved choices substantially exacerbate adverse selection, leading to an overall reduction in welfare ("When Nudging Hurts").

## Related Literature
- Farrell and Klemperer (2007): survey related work on switching costs and discuss how the inability of researchers to observe active or initial choices within a micro-level panel dataset confounds their ability to separately identify switching costs from persistent unobserved preference heterogeneity.

## Contribution
- Explicitly quantify the value of inertia and other micro-foundations
- Use those estimates to study the interaction between inertia and adverse selection

# Details of the Paper

## Preliminary Analysis

Descriptive analysis to see the existence of inertia and adverse selection.

1. New Employees
- Compare the choices over time of the cohorts of new enrollees from years $t_{−1}$, $t_{0}$, and $t_{1}$.
- Results: while it is evident that the $t_{0}$ and $t_{−1}$ cohorts make very similar choices with the default option at $t_{1}$, the new enrollees making active choices in that year have a very different choice profile that reflects the price changes for $t_{1}$.

2. Dominated Plan Choice
- leverages a specific situation caused by the combination of plan characteristics and plan price changes in our setting. 
- As a result of the large price changes for year $t_{1}$, $PPO_{250}$ became _strictly dominated_ for certain combinations of family size and income, which determine employee premium contributions.
- Without inertia, employees must switch their options to monetary advantageous one.
- Results show that only a fraction of employees change their insurance option.

3. Adverse Selection
- The more the employees are riskier, the more likely they enroll in more comprehensive plan.

## Model

- Choice Model: consumer's choice conditional on predicted family-level ex ante medical cost risk
- Cost Model: generates the expenditure distributions

### Choice Model
- $k \in \mathcal{K}$: a family unit
- $j \in \mathcal{J}$: one of the three PPO insurance plans available after the $t_{0}$ menu change
- $t \in \mathcal{T}$: one of the three years from $t_{0}$ to $t_{2}$
- $F_{kjt}(\cdot)$: family-plan-time specific distributions of out-of-pocket health expenditures (output by the cost model)

- Each family has the following latent, v-NM expected utility:
$$
U_{kjt} = \int^{\infty}_{0} f_{kjt}(OOP)u_{k}(W_{k}, OOP, P_{kjt}, 1_{kj, t-1})dOOP,
$$
- $OOP$: a realization of medical expenses from $F_{kjt}(\cdot)$
- $W_{k}$: family-specific wealth
- $P_{kjt}$: family-time-specific premium contribution for plan $j$
- $1_{kj, t-1}$: an indicator of whether the family was enrolled in plan $j$ in the previous time period
- $u_{k}(\cdot)$: v-NM utility index and assumed to be CARA preferences:

$$
u_{k}(x) = - \frac{1}{\gamma_{k}(\mathbf{X}^{A}_{k})}e^{\gamma_{k}(\mathbf{X}^{A}_{k})x}.
$$
- $\gamma_{k}$ is a family-specific preference parameter that is known to the family but unobserved to the econometrician
- A family's overall level of consumption $x$ conditional on $OOP$ from $F_{kjt}(\cdot)$:
$$
x = W_{k} - P_{kjt} - OOP + \eta(\mathbf{X}^{B}_{kt}, Y_{k})1_{kj, t-1} + \delta_{k}(Y_{k})1_{1200} + \alpha H_{k, t-1}1_{250} + \epsilon_{kjt}(Y_{k})
$$

### Cost Model

The cost model is developed and estimated the following procedure:

- Leverage the Johns Hopkins ACG Case-Mix software package
- For each individual and open enrollment period, we use the past year of diagnoses, drugs and expenses, along with age, gender, to predict mean total expenditures for the upcoming year
- Grouping individuals into cells based on mean predicted future utilization, estimate a spending distribution for the upcoming year
- Combine individual total expense projections into the family out-of-pocket expense projections used in the choice model $F_{kjt}$

The cost model assumes that there is no private information and no moral hazard (total expenditures do not vary with $j$). While both of these phenomena have the potential to be important in health care markets, these assumptions are believed to have less impact the results, relative to inertia.

### Identification

The model separately identify inertia from persistent unobserved preference heterogeneity by leveraging three features of the data and environment.

- The plan menu change and forced re-enrollment at year $t_{0}$ ensures that we observe each family in our final sample making both an “active” and a “passive” choice from the same set of health plans over time, in the context of meaningful relative price changes
- The three $PPO$ plan options we study have the exact same network of medical providers and cover the same medical services, implying that differentiation occurs only through preferences for plan financial characteristics (here, risk preferences)
- Since insurance choice here is effectively a choice between different financial lotteries, our detailed medical data allow us to precisely quantify health risk and the ex ante value consumers should have for health plans, con- ditional on risk preferences and the assumption that beliefs conform to $F_{kjt}$

We separately identify the two sources of persistent preference heterogeneity $\gamma$ (risk preferences) and $\delta$ ($PPO_{1200}$ differentiation) by leveraging the structure of the three available choices.

- $\gamma$ is identified by the choice between $PPO_{250}$ and $PPO_{500}$, which are not horizontally differentiated
- $\delta$ is identified by examining the choice between the nest of those two plans and $PPO_{1200}$

## Estimation

**Statistical Assumptions**

- Assume that the random coefficient $\gamma_{k}$ is normally distributed with a mean that is linearly related to observable characteristics $\mathbf{X}^{A}_{k}$:
$$
\gamma_{k}(\mathbf{X}^{A}_{k}) \rightarrow N(\mu_{\gamma}(\mathbf{X}^{A}_{k}), \sigma^{2}_{\gamma}) \\
\mu_{\gamma}(\mathbf{X}^{A}_{k}) = \mu + \mathbf{\beta}(\mathbf{X}^{A}_{k})
$$

- Denote the mean and variance of $\delta_{k}$, the random intercept for $PPO_{1200}$, as $\mu_{\delta}(Y_{k})$ and $\sigma^{2}_{\delta}(Y_{k})$
- Inertia, $\eta(\mathbf{X}^{B}_{kt}, Y_{k})$, is related linearly to $Y_{k}$ and linked choices and demographics $\mathbf{X}^{B}_{kt}$

$$
\eta(\mathbf{X}^{B}_{kt}, Y_{k}) = \eta_{0} + \mathbf{\eta}_{1}\mathbf{X}^{B}_{kt} + \eta_{2}Y_{k}
$$

- Assume that the family-plan-time specific error terms $\epsilon_{kjt}$ are i.i.d. normal for each j with zero mean and variances $\sigma^{2}_{\epsilon_{j}}(Y_{k})$

**Estimation Method**

- Estimate the choice model using a random coefficients simulated maximum likelihood approach similar to that summarized in Train (2009)
- The likelihood function at the family level is computed for a sequence of choices from $t_{0}$ to $t_{2}$, since inertia implies that the likelihood of a choice made in the current period depends on the previous choice
- See online appendix B in more detail

## Estimation Results

- See Table 5 in this paper
- Inertia is substantial, whose mean is $2,032

## Counterfactual Simulations

- Conduct counterfactual analysis to study the welfare consequences of reduced inertia in the following settings
  - a _"naive"_ setting where the price of insurance does not change as a consequence of incremental selection
  - a _"sophisticated"_ setting where plan prices change to reflect the new risk profile of employees enrolled in the different options

### Model of Reduced Inertia and Plan Pricing

- Assume the policy being implemented reduces inertia to a fraction $Z$ of the family-specific estimate $\eta_{k}$
- The expected utility of family $k$ for plan $j$ at time $t$ is

$$
U_{kjt}(P_{kjt}, Z\eta_{k}, 1_{kj, t-1}) = \int^{\infty}_{0} f_{kjt}(OOP)u_{k}(OOP, \widehat{P_{kjt}}, Z\eta_{k}, 1_{kj, t-1})dOOP,
$$

- Next, we model insurance plan pricing, following the pricing rule used by the firm during the time period studied
- The total premium paid by employer and employee, $TP^{y}_{jt}$, for each plan and year was set as the average plan cost for that plan's previous year of enrollees, plus an administrative markup, conditional on the dependent coverage tier denoted $y$:

$$
TP^{y}_{jt} = AC_{\mathcal{K}^{y}_{j, t-1}} + L = \frac{1}{\|\mathcal{K}^{y}_{j, t-1}\|}\sum_{k \in \mathcal{K}^{y}_{j, t-1}}PP_{kj, t-1} + L
$$

- $\mathcal{K}^{y}_{j, t-1}$ refers to the population of families in plan $j$ at time $t−1$ in coverage tier $y$
- $PP_{kj, t−1}$ is the total plan paid in medical expenditures conditional on $y$ and $j$ at $t − 1$
- $TP^{y}_{jt}$ is the amount an employee in dependent category $y$ enrolling in plan $j$ would have to pay each year if they received no health insurance subsidy from the firm
- The firm subsidizes insurance for each employee as a percentage of the total $PPO_{1200}$ promium conditional of the family's income tier, $I_{k}$
- Denote the subsidy $S(I_{k})$
- The family-plan-time specific out-of-pocket premium $\hat{P_{kjt}}$ from the choice model is

$$
\widehat{P_{kjt}} = TP^{y}_{jt} - S(I_{k})TP^{y}_{PPO_{1200}t}
$$

### Welfare

- We analyze welfare using **a certainty equivalent approach** that equates the expected utility for each potential health plan option, $U_{kjt}$, with a certain monetary payment $Q$
- Formally, the certainty equivalent $Q_{kjt}$ is determined for each family, plan, and time period by solving

$$
u(Q_{kjt}) = -\frac{1}{\gamma_{k}(\mathbf{X}^{A}_{k})} e^{\gamma_{k}(\mathbf{X}^{A}_{k})(W - Q_{kjt})} = U_{kjt}(P_{kjt}, Z\eta_{k}, 1_{kj, t-1})
$$

- This welfare measure translates the expected utilities, which are subject to cardinal transformations, into values that can be interpreted in monetary terms[^1]

[^1]:確実性等価（Certainty Equivalent）は不確実性なOutcomeに対する期待効用と同等の効用をもたらす（確実な）金額。期待効用をそれに対応する金額（Monetary Value）で評価を行うことができるため、不確実性のあるマーケットの厚生評価に用いられる（Einav, Finkelstein and Cullen (2010)も参照。）。

- Since our empirical choice framework does not distinguish between sources of inertia, we study a range of welfare results spanning the case where inertia is not incorporated into the welfare calculation at all to the case where it is fully incorporated as a tangible cost
- Formally, we calculate the certainty equivalent loss as a function of the proportion of the cost of inertia that enters the welfare calculation, denoted $\kappa$:

$$
u(Q^{\kappa}_{kjt}) = -\frac{1}{\gamma_{k}(\mathbf{X}^{A}_{k})} e^{\gamma_{k}(\mathbf{X}^{A}_{k})(W - Q^{\kappa}_{kjt})} = U_{kjt}(P_{kjt}, \kappa Z \eta_{k}, 1_{kj, t-1})
$$

- We investigate the welfare consequences of policies that reduce inertia to $Z\eta$, for $\kappa$ between zero and one
- Conditional on $\kappa$, the welfare impact for consumer $k$ of policies that reduce inertia to $Z\eta_{k}$ is

$$
\Delta CS^{Z}_{kjt} = (W - Q^{\kappa}_{k, jZ, t}) - (W - Q^{\kappa}_{kjt}) = Q^{\kappa}_{kjt} - Q^{\kappa}_{k, jZ, t}
$$

- Since total premiums relate directly to average costs, the total welfare change differs from the consumer welfare only if the sum of employee contributions $P_{kjt}$ differs between policy $Z$ and the benchmark model
- Given this, the mean per-family welfare change with inertia reduced to $Z\eta$ is

$$
\Delta TS^{Z}_{t} = \frac{1}{\|\mathcal{K}\|}\sum_{k \in \mathcal{K}}\Delta CS^{Z}_{kjt} + \frac{1}{\|\mathcal{K}\|}\sum_{k \in \mathcal{K}}(\widehat{P^{Z}_{kj, t}} - P_{kjt})
$$
